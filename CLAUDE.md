# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

oca — a native Rust video editor (`egui`/`eframe`) for cutting gameplay footage for the
PacoPaçoca YouTube channel. Headline features: automatic loudness normalization and
export-that-matches-the-source-bitrate. Full phased plan: [`features/request.md`](features/request.md).

## Status

Fase 1-8 of the original phased plan (`features/request.md`) are done — probe/export/loudness/
proxy, timeline editing, effects/keyframes/AI features, export queue, robustness, performance
work, and packaging/auto-update all shipped. **Detailed status now lives in `spec/`, not here**
— start at [`spec/INDEX.md`](spec/INDEX.md), then [`spec/ROADMAP.md`](spec/ROADMAP.md) to pick
up the next task. `spec/matrix/*.md` are done/needed checklists per area (engine, timeline,
effects, AI features, preview pipeline, robustness, performance, packaging); `spec/matrix/
changelog.md` is the old narrative status log (verification caveats, real bugs found, empirical
discoveries) moved here verbatim; `spec/architecture/*.md` covers the newly-proposed
differentiator features and the performance/caching patterns ported from nimble (sibling
project). Check `features/request.md` for the original plan's own wording before assuming a
Fase-4+ feature is live — when in doubt, `graphify query`.

## Commands

Requires Rust (stable) via rustup. `avbridge` needs `FFMPEG_DIR` set to an FFmpeg dev
build (`include/`+`lib/`); its DLLs must be on `PATH` at runtime. `core`'s `preview`
module needs GStreamer discoverable via `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`. `core`'s `whisper-rs` dependency
needs `LIBCLANG_PATH` pointing at a libclang install (bindgen) and a build directory that
isn't under `%TEMP%` on Windows (MSVC's FileTracker fails there — `FTK1011`).

**Ubuntu 24.04's packaged FFmpeg (6.1.1, via `apt install libavformat-dev` etc.) is too old
to build `avbridge`.** `csrc/filters.c` calls `avcodec_get_supported_config`/
`AV_CODEC_CONFIG_SAMPLE_FORMAT`/`AV_CODEC_CONFIG_SAMPLE_RATE`, added in FFmpeg 7.1 — a plain
`apt`-installed FFmpeg dev build on noble fails with "undeclared identifier" on that file
specifically, before reaching any of this project's own logic. A sandboxed session without
network access to fetch a newer FFmpeg build (or without access to `cdn.pyke.io` for `ort`'s
prebuilt ONNX Runtime binaries — set `ORT_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1` to defer *that* failure past `cargo
check`, same idea as the GPU-encoder note below) can't get a full `cargo check`/`build`/`test`
to pass — same category of pre-existing, machine-specific build gap as the GPU encoder note
below, not a code regression. `cargo fmt --check` still works (parses each file independently,
no dependency build needed) and is a reasonable sanity check when a full build isn't possible.
For `avbridge/csrc/*.c` changes specifically, `gcc -fsyntax-only -I <ffmpeg-include-dir>
-Wall -Wextra <file>.c` run per-file from `crates/avbridge/csrc/` is a real (if partial)
compiler check that still works even when the whole crate can't build — it only needs the
headers *that file* includes, so it stays clean for every file except `filters.c` itself even
on Ubuntu's too-old packaged FFmpeg. It won't catch link-time or runtime/filtergraph-semantic
issues, but it does catch real syntax/type errors no amount of manual review guarantees.

**Two of this gap's usual co-blockers are actually fixable in a sandboxed session, worth trying
before assuming a full build is out of reach**: a too-old bundled `rustc` (this repo's
`Cargo.lock` can need a newer one than a session starts with) — try `rustup update stable` first,
it may just work with no network restrictions beyond crates.io/static.rust-lang.org; and a
missing `gstreamer-1.0` pkg-config file (`core`'s `preview` module) — `apt-get install
libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-dev
libgstreamer-plugins-good1.0-dev` (then `export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
pkgconfig`) resolved it in one session where apt had a working mirror. Neither fixes the
FFmpeg-too-old `filters.c` gap itself, but both get a `cargo check -p core` past every *other*
failure first, so the one true remaining blocker is confirmed in isolation rather than assumed.
A pure-logic module with no `avbridge`/GStreamer dependency can still be fully verified despite
all of this: copy just that file (plus its `#[cfg(test)]` module) into a throwaway scratch crate
with no dependencies and `cargo test` it there — real execution, not just a parse check.

**Do not remove `avbridge/build.rs`'s import-lib-renaming step.** GStreamer bundles its
own FFmpeg (gst-libav) with identically named import libs — `build.rs` copies them into
`OUT_DIR` under unique names to prevent silent ABI-mismatch linking at runtime.

```bash
make build     # debug build, whole workspace
make run       # run the GUI app (debug)
make test      # run every crate's test suite
make test-core # cargo test -p core only
make test-e2e  # pytest + pywinauto against a built target/debug/ui.exe
make bench     # criterion benchmarks -> target/criterion/report/index.html
make fmt       # cargo fmt --all
make lint      # cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
make check     # cargo check --workspace --all-targets (fast compile-only loop)
```

Single test: `cargo test -p core --test probe_test measure_loudness` or
`cargo test -p ui i18n::tests`.

**End-to-end tests** (`e2e/`) drive the real `ui.exe` via Windows UI Automation
(`pytest` + `pywinauto`, `backend="uia"`). One-time setup:
`python -m pip install -r e2e/requirements.txt`. **Use a real Python, not a Windows Store
alias** — a Store-packaged `python.exe` carries MSIX package identity that breaks DLL
loading for spawned child processes (`ui.exe` crashes with `STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND` even with
`PATH` set correctly), while the identical binary launched directly from PowerShell works
fine. Needs a debug build first and FFmpeg/GStreamer DLL dirs on `PATH` (`make test-e2e`
exports both). The `oca_window` fixture calls `set_focus()` before yielding — without it,
synthetic clicks land on whatever window has focus.

## Architecture

Three-crate split, enforced by dependency direction: `avbridge` → `core` → `ui`.

- **`avbridge`** — thin C bridge (`csrc/bridge.c`) over libavformat/libavcodec/libavfilter/
  libavutil, called via FFI. Exposes probing, timeline export rendering, loudness
  measurement, proxy generation, and waveform extraction.
- **`core`** — project/timeline/media data model plus wrappers (`probe`, `render`,
  `loudness`, `proxy`, `waveform`), GStreamer playback pipeline (`preview`), and `.ocproj`
  save/load (`persistence`) — gzip-compressed MessagePack (struct-map mode, so
  `#[serde(default)]` still lets an older-saved project load after a new field is added).
  Locale-neutral — stores enums, never pre-formatted strings. No mock/sample data anywhere.
- **`ui`** — eframe/egui GUI (glow/OpenGL): `app.rs` holds `App` and mutation methods;
  `screens/` has one module per screen; `theme.rs` is the dark/teal palette; **all UI
  strings live in `i18n.rs`** (pt-BR and English) — never hardcode display text.

Test placement: `core` and `avbridge` have `[lib]` targets → integration tests in
`crates/<crate>/tests/`. `ui` is bin-only → unit tests in `src/<module>/<module>_test.rs`.

## Approach

- Read existing files before writing. Don't re-read unless changed.
- Thorough in reasoning, concise in output.
- Skip files over 100KB unless required.
- No sycophantic openers or closing fluff. No emojis or em-dashes.
- Do not guess APIs, versions, flags, or package names. Verify by reading code or docs.
- Write all code and commit messages in English.
- Commit using Conventional Commits format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.).
- Keep commits small and split by crate/layer — never bundle `avbridge` (C/FFI), `core`, `ui`,
  and test changes for one feature into a single commit. Commit each layer separately, in
  dependency order (`avbridge` → `core` → `ui` → tests), even when they land in the same
  session for the same feature. A commit that only adds/changes tests for already-committed
  code gets its own `test:`-prefixed commit rather than being folded into the `feat:` commit
  it covers.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at `graphify-out/` with god nodes, community structure,
and cross-file relationships.

- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when `graphify-out/graph.json`
  exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"`
  for focused concepts.
- If `graphify-out/wiki/index.md` exists, use it for broad navigation.
- Read `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` only for broad architecture review or when
  query/path/explain don't surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current.
