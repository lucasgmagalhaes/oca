   matte (see `avcore::background_removal::segment_person`), not meant to ever be shown to the

   attempt: this is a small internal artifact, not worth the hardware-encoder fallback ladder
   `open_video_encoder` uses for the main export path).

   `luma_frames` holds `frame_count` frames back-to-back, each `width * height` bytes
   (row-major, one byte per pixel — frame `i` starts at `luma_frames + (size_t)i * width *
   height`). Each output frame is encoded as YUV420P with the supplied bytes as the luma plane
   and both chroma planes filled with the neutral value 128 ("no color") — "grayscale-as-luma"
   rather than a true single-plane GRAY8 stream, since whether this FFmpeg build's
   `libopenh264` wrapper accepts `AV_PIX_FMT_GRAY8` input is unverified. Frame `i` gets pts `i`
   at `fps_num/fps_den` — this function has no notion of any original clip's timing, just its
   own frame count and rate.

   Returns MATTE_ERR_EMPTY immediately if frame_count <= 0 or width/height/fps_num/fps_den <=
