/* Opens a video H.264 encoder AVCodecContext sized for canvas_width/canvas_height/canvas_fps
   at canvas_bit_rate_bps, honoring `preference`. Tries the requested hardware encoder(s) first
   (AUTO tries all four in a fixed order). Each software-frame candidate's requested pixel
   format comes from
   gpu_encoder.c's pix_fmt_for_encoder_name(): AV_PIX_FMT_YUV420P for every encoder except
   h264_qsv, which gets AV_PIX_FMT_NV12 — the same format the existing filter chains already
   conform every segment to for the other encoders (see e.g. timeline_export.c's final
   `format=yuv420p` stage). This split exists because h264_qsv was empirically observed on
   this dev machine's FFmpeg build to reject yuv420p outright ("Specified pixel format yuv420p
   is not supported by the h264_qsv encoder", listing only nv12/qsv as supported) even without
   real Quick Sync hardware present — a mismatch indistinguishable, before this fix, from "no
   GPU/driver available", so it always fell through to the CPU fallback. avcodec_open2() still
   fails at runtime for the ordinary "no compatible GPU/driver" case too — that's still treated
   identically here as "unavailable, fall back to CPU", it just no longer also catches Quick
   Sync's format mismatch.

   NVENC/AMF didn't reach the pix_fmt check at all on this machine (no NVIDIA GPU; AMD's
   amfrt64.dll isn't present), so whether they accept yuv420p directly on real hardware remains
   unverified — left unchanged since no observed failure justifies changing them. Likewise,
   fixing the yuv420p/nv12 mismatch does not by itself prove h264_qsv successfully *encodes* on
   real Quick Sync hardware — this function (like the rest of the GPU-encoder path) can't be
   exercised against real GPU hardware in this environment. The CPU fallback path itself IS
   exercised end-to-end for every preference value (see encode_test.rs's
   every_gpu_encoder_preference_falls_back_to_a_working_export), since forcing any hardware
   preference on this machine deterministically falls through to it. VAAPI is different from
   the other candidates: h264_vaapi consumes AV_PIX_FMT_VAAPI hardware surfaces. Its setup
   creates a VAAPI device and an NV12-backed AVHWFramesContext; filters.c uploads the software
   NV12 filter output into that pool before avcodec_send_frame. On Linux, OCA_VAAPI_DEVICE may
   name an explicit render node; otherwise /dev/dri/renderD128..191 are tried before FFmpeg's
   default device resolution. Missing drivers/devices/permissions all fall through to CPU.

   If none of the attempted encoders open, falls back to the CPU (libopenh264) encoder — the
   "fallback pro encode por CPU" from the Fase 5 spec. Sets *out_used_gpu to 1 if a hardware
   encoder was actually opened, 0 if the CPU fallback (or explicit GPU_ENCODER_CPU) was used.
   If `out_pix_fmt` is non-NULL, sets it to the software pixel format the filter graph must emit
   (yuv420p or nv12). For VAAPI this deliberately differs from enc_ctx->pix_fmt
   (AV_PIX_FMT_VAAPI), because encode_write_packet performs the software-to-hardware upload.
   Callers must build their filter graph's final `format=...` conform stage to target this
   instead of hardcoding yuv420p. `global_header` should be nonzero when the output format wants
   AV_CODEC_FLAG_GLOBAL_HEADER set (out_ctx->oformat->flags & AVFMT_GLOBALHEADER).

   Returns NULL only if even the CPU fallback couldn't open (should only happen if libopenh264
   itself is missing from this FFmpeg build). Caller owns the returned AVCodecContext (not yet
   attached to any AVStream). Defined in gpu_encoder.c. */
