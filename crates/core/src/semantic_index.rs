//! CF-08: semantic transcript and visual media search
//! ([`spec/architecture/competitive-feature-plan.md`](../../../../spec/architecture/competitive-feature-plan.md)'s
//! own "Outcome: locate moments using queries such as 'boss fight', 'victory screen', or a
//! phrase spoken by the presenter").
//!
//! CF-08's slice 1 (exact transcript search) already shipped as part of CF-01 —
//! [`crate::transcript_search`]. This module is slice 2 ("Add a versioned local index keyed by
//! media content fingerprint and model version") plus the storage/scoring half of slice 4
//! ("Return timestamped results with the source of the match... or a combined score").
//! **Deliberately not attempted here: computing any real embedding.** A real semantic-search
//! embedding model (text and/or visual) needs network access to fetch model weights and
//! `libonnxruntime` — this sandbox has neither (the same `ORT_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1`/no-network gap
//! `CLAUDE.md` documents for `background_removal`/`auto_reframe`). So [`IndexedChunk::embedding`]
//! is an opaque `Vec<f32>` this module never produces itself — a real embedding-computation
//! slice, and the incremental frame/transcript-chunk sampling pass that would call it (slice 3),
//! are genuine, separate follow-ups once a model can actually be verified against. What's here —
//! the versioned index shape, fingerprint-based invalidation, a bounded storage budget, and
//! cosine-similarity search/combination over whatever embeddings a caller supplies — is real,
//! useful, and fully testable without one.
