//! A shared seek-and-poll frame sampling primitive against an already-open [`Preview`]
//! pipeline — the shape `ui`'s auto-reframe, motion tracking, and background-removal matte
//! generation background-thread functions each independently reimplemented before this existed
//! (open a decode-only `Preview`, seek to a timestamp, poll `current_frame()` until it decodes
//! or a deadline passes, skip the sample on timeout rather than failing the whole run). See
//! `spec/architecture/performance-and-caching.md` §5.
//!
//! Deliberately doesn't know what a sampled frame is *for* — face detection, block matching,
//! and person segmentation all stay exactly where they were, in each `ui` feature's own
//! background-thread function; this only owns the open/seek/poll mechanics and the "N evenly
//! spaced sample times across a duration, clamped" bookkeeping every multi-sample caller needed
//! on top of it.
