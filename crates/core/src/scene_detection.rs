//! D4 (`spec/architecture/differentiators.md`): detects hard scene cuts (loading screen, death
//! screen, menu transition) from a mean-absolute-luma-difference score between consecutive
//! sampled frames — a hard cut shows up as a large jump, unlike a gradual pan/zoom or in-game
//! motion. Deliberately pure and frame-source-agnostic: the caller (`ui`'s background-thread
//! scene-cut detection, mirroring `motion_tracking`'s own split) owns sampling frames via
//! [`crate::FrameSampler`] and converting them via [`crate::motion_tracking::rgba_to_gray`] —
//! reused rather than reimplemented, same grayscale conversion motion tracking already needed.
