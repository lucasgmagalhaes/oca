//! Automatic speech transcription — Fase 4's "Legendas automáticas". Runs a local Whisper
//! model (whisper.cpp via the `whisper-rs` crate) fully offline: audio is decoded/resampled to
//! the 16kHz mono float PCM whisper.cpp requires via `avbridge::extract_pcm_16k_mono` (no
//! subprocess, same FFI-not-shell-out approach as every other `avbridge` call), then run
//! through Whisper's inference to produce timestamped segments.
//!
//! Release bundles include Whisper Base under `resources/models/`; callers still pass the path
//! explicitly so tests and advanced users can supply another compatible GGML model.
