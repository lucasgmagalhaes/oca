//! Structured runtime telemetry — `request.md`'s Fase 7 "Telemetria de runtime": local,
//! append-only JSON-lines records of usage events (import/export duration, preview frame
//! time, error events). Stays on-device only — nothing here ever leaves the machine or talks
//! to a network, matching `request.md`'s explicit "fica no dispositivo por padrão" wording —
//! `ui` decides *where* the file lives (see `App::telemetry_path`, next to the platform log
//! directory Fase 6's `tracing` file appender already writes to) and whether the user has
//! opted out; this module only knows how to append one record given an already-resolved path.
//!
//! **CPU/RAM resource sampling** ([`ResourceUsage`][TelemetryEvent::ResourceUsage],
//! [`sample_resource_usage`]) is now wired in via `sysinfo`. **GPU usage from `request.md`'s
//! full wishlist is still not covered** — `sysinfo` has no cross-platform GPU reader; a
//! vendor-specific one (NVML for NVIDIA, similar for AMD/Intel) is a materially bigger,
//! hardware-dependent lift than this slice covers, same "hard wall, not just unattempted"
//! posture this codebase already applies to the GPU encoder ladder and the preview-only
//! GStreamer-element gaps documented in `CLAUDE.md`.
