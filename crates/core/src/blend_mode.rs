//! CPU reimplementation of FFmpeg's `blend` filter's 8-bit `all_mode` formulas
//! ([`crate::timeline::BlendMode`]), for live-preview compositing where GStreamer's
//! `compositor` element (only `source`/`over`/`add` Porter-Duff operators — verified via
//! `gst-inspect-1.0 compositor` against this project's GStreamer) can't do the job
//! ([`crate::preview`] builds a dedicated `appsink` branch per blend-mode layer instead and
//! composites its frames against the accumulated stack here, per-frame).
//!
//! Every formula below is transcribed term-for-term from FFmpeg's own source
//! (`libavfilter/blend_modes.c`, `DEPTH == 8` branch, `n6.1.1`) rather than reimplemented from
//! documentation or memory, and cross-checked against real `ffmpeg -f lavfi ... blend=all_mode=`
//! output on 256x256 gradient test images (every mode: max abs diff 0, except `interpolate`
//! which is 1 — float rounding) before being trusted here. FFmpeg's macro names are kept as
//! local helper functions (`multiply`, `screen`, `burn`, `dodge`, `geometric`) to keep the
//! mapping obvious; `A`/`B` in FFmpeg's source are `top`/`bottom` respectively — this crate's own
//! doc comments elsewhere establish the same top/bottom convention (a blend-mode layer is "top",
//! blending onto the accumulated stack beneath it as "bottom").
//!
//! FFmpeg's formulas are written in C `int` arithmetic and *rely on unsigned-narrowing wraparound
//! on assignment to `uint8_t`* for a few modes that are not explicitly clamped in the source
//! (`bleach`, `stain`) — e.g. `stain`'s `2*MAX - A - B` can reach 510 and wraps to `254`,
//! `(510 as u8)` in two's-complement truncation, not a clamp to 255. [`blend_channel`] reproduces
//! this exactly via `as u8` (Rust's `i32 -> u8` cast is the same bit-truncating conversion C's
//! implicit unsigned-narrowing assignment performs), rather than clamping — clamping would silently
//! diverge from what export (FFmpeg's own filter) actually produces for those two modes.
