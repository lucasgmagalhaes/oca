//! Provider-neutral error-reporting contract (ER-01A, the first phase of ROADMAP P5's
//! ER-01). **Deliberately contains no networking and no Sentry (or any other provider) SDK
//! dependency** — everything here is the allowlisted report schema, the stable error codes,
//! the sanitizer that scrubs forbidden content out of free-form fields, the schema validator,
//! the bounded queue envelope, and the `ErrorReporter` abstraction with its consent-disabled
//! `NullReporter`. The transport (a background delivery worker + provider adapter) is UI-layer
//! work that lands in ER-01B, keyed off this module's types, never reaching past them.
//!
//! The existing local diagnostics stay exactly where they are: [`crate::telemetry`]'s JSON-lines
//! file (`ui`'s `telemetry.jsonl`) and the crash file `ui`'s `main.rs` panic hook writes. This
//! module is a *different, separate* path — the existing `TelemetryEvent::Error` carries
//! free-form strings and user content and **must not** become the remote transport (see the
//! ER-01 design doc's own warning). Nothing in this module ever takes a [`crate::telemetry::
//! TelemetryEvent`] or leaks provider types across its public boundary.
//!
//! The remote contract is an *allowlist*, not a blacklist: a report is a fixed set of typed
//! fields, and any string field that still contains forbidden content (paths, URLs, credentials,
//! emails) after sanitization is rejected by [`validate_report`] and dropped. What leaves the
//! machine is strictly the post-sanitization form.
