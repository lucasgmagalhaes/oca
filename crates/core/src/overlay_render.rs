//! Rasterizes a [`crate::timeline::TextClip`] or [`crate::timeline::ShapeClip`] into a single
//! full-canvas RGBA buffer — text export now writes this exact buffer to a temporary PNG while
//! shape export still uses a `geq` avfilter pass ([`crate::render`], [`crate::shape_render`]),
//! only ever run against an already-encoded file and have no live GStreamer element equivalent
//! ([`crate::preview`]'s doc comment previously listed this as a known gap — see
//! `Preview::open_composited`, which now feeds each buffer this module builds into the
//! compositor as its own static overlay branch).
//!
//! Both clip kinds have static geometry for their whole visible span (no keyframes on either
//! type). Shape preview therefore needs one RGBA buffer only. Text preview also starts with one,
//! then replaces it only when playback enters another timed word; `imagefreeze` repeats the
//! latest buffer between boundaries without per-video-frame rasterization.
//!
//! Text shapes and rasterizes through [`crate::text_layout`]'s `cosmic-text` adapter
//! (TEXT-01A step 3 — see that module's own doc comment), wrapping at word boundaries once a
//! line would run past the canvas's right edge. Word-highlight timing
//! ([`crate::timeline::TextClip::words`]) is rendered through [`render_text_clip_rgba`]'s
//! `local_time_secs` parameter. Preview calls it on word-boundary changes; export emits one
//! precisely timed PNG overlay per word.
//!
//! Shapes mirror [`crate::shape_render::build_shape_filter_desc`]'s per-pixel math term-for-term
//! (rotate into the shape's local frame, then an ellipse quadratic or
//! [`crate::shape_render::point_in_polygon`] ray-cast), just evaluated directly against a pixel
//! buffer in Rust instead of compiled into a `geq` expression string.

/// buffer rendered once (like [`render_text_clip_rgba`]/[`render_shape_clip_rgba`]) covers the
/// clip's whole visible span. Returns an all-zero (fully masked) buffer for
/// [`MaskShape::None`] — callers gate on [`crate::timeline::ClipInstance::is_masked`]
/// before calling this at all, so that case shouldn't be reached in practice.
