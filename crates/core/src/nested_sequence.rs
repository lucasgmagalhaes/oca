//! Nested sequences / compound clips (`spec/ROADMAP.md`, `matrix/competitor-parity.md`'s
//! 2026-08-27 update) — Premiere/DaVinci/FCP all let a group of clips be edited as its own
//! sub-timeline, then dropped onto a parent timeline as a single clip. oca already has
//! independently-editable [`crate::project::Sequence`]s (the Editor's tabs) — a compound clip
//! reuses that directly rather than inventing a second sub-timeline concept:
//! [`crate::timeline::ClipInstance::nested_sequence_id`] points at another `Sequence` in the
//! same [`crate::project::Project`] instead of `asset_id`.
//!
//! The render/preview pipeline needs to *recurse* into that sequence, not just carry a pointer
//! (per this feature's own scoping note in `matrix/competitor-parity.md`) — [`materialize_nested_sequences`]
//! does that by actually rendering each nested sequence to a cached temp file, then handing back
//! a synthetic [`MediaAsset`] per nested clip pointing at that file. Every existing resolution
//! function ([`crate::render::resolve_timeline_segments_multi`] and friends) then treats a
//! compound clip exactly like an ordinary asset-backed one — zero changes needed to their own
//! logic, and every per-clip effect (crop/color/keyframes/...) still applies on top of the
//! rendered nested content for free, since it's the same [`crate::timeline::ClipInstance`].
//!
//! **Known cost, deliberately not hidden**: unlike an imported asset, a nested sequence's
//! rendered file is produced by a real encode, not instant. `ui`'s callers (queueing an export,
//! opening a preview) call this synchronously and block until it's done — no background-thread/
//! progress-reporting path yet, a real UX rough edge for a long nested sequence. Caching (keyed
//! on the nested sequence's own [`crate::timeline::Timeline`] content — cheap `PartialEq`, no
//! hashing) means this cost is paid once per edit to that nested sequence, not on every call.
