//! D7 (`spec/architecture/differentiators.md`): packages a project handoff bundle — the
//! project's `.ocproj` snapshot plus its already-generated editing proxies (see
//! [`crate::proxy`]) — into one portable `.zip`, so handing an edit off to a collaborator never
//! means moving the multi-GB source recordings around. [`export_collab_bundle`] only ever reads
//! what's already on disk (nothing is (re)transcoded); [`import_collab_bundle`] unpacks it back
//! into the shape the recipient's own app already knows how to find (the same
//! [`crate::proxy::cache_dir_for_project`] location their app would compute for wherever they
//! choose to save the project), so their preview picks the proxies up with no extra wiring —
//! even though the original source is never part of the bundle and likely isn't at
//! [`crate::media::MediaAsset::source_path`] on their machine at all.
