/// Extracts the `[window_start_secs, window_end_secs)` slice of `timeline` into a new,
/// standalone [`Timeline`] rebased so the window's start lands at `0.0`.
///
/// Video/Audio track clips ([`crate::timeline::ClipInstance`]) straddling either boundary are
/// split precisely (via [`Track::split_clip_at`], consuming ids from `next_clip_id`) so the
/// short's visual/audio content isn't truncated mid-clip — the same split primitive
/// `App::split_at_playhead` already uses. Text/Shape overlays are simpler but less safe to
/// split: a [`crate::timeline::TextClip`]'s word-highlight timing is relative to the clip's own
/// `start_secs`, so trimming it mid-clip without also re-deriving which words still fit would
/// silently desync captions from audio. Only overlay clips *entirely* within the window are
/// kept; one straddling either edge is dropped rather than risking that.
///
