//! CF-01 (`spec/architecture/competitive-feature-plan.md`) slices 4-5 — build a *proposed-edit
//! list* from a [`crate::transcript::TranscriptDocument`] (slice 1) and apply the accepted
//! proposals as one undoable edit. Pure analysis lives here; the apply orchestration (staging a
//! review on `App`, ripple-deleting the accepted ranges with a single undo snapshot) lives in
//! the UI side, mirroring D1's silence-review flow.
//!
//! All four proposal kinds are derived from the same media-relative word stream, so they need
//! nothing beyond [`crate::transcript::TranscriptWord`]'s existing text + timestamps + stable
//! ids — no audio decode, no waveform, no Whisper re-run:
//!
//! - **Dead air** (`TranscriptEditKind::DeadAir`) — a long pause *between* two consecutive
//!   words (their `gap = next.start - this.end` exceeds [`DEAD_AIR_THRESHOLD_SECS`]). The
//!   transcript knows speech boundaries precisely, so this is transcript-derived dead air,
//!   complementary to (not a replacement for) D1's waveform-based silence detection.
//! - **Filler word** (`FillerWord`) — a run of consecutive words from the language's filler set
//!   (`uh`/`um`/`tipo`/`né`/...), conservative by design: only clear vocalized fillers, never
//!   ambiguous common words.
//! - **Retake** (`Retake`) — an immediate false-start self-repetition of one word (or two)
//!   back-to-back ("the the", "I I I", "tipo tipo") — the repeated tail is proposed.
//! - **Repeated phrase** (`RepeatedPhrase`) — a 2-4 word phrase repeated within a short window
//!   ([`REPEAT_WINDOW_SECS`]); the *second* occurrence is proposed as the deletable duplicate.
//!
//! Proposals from the different kinds can overlap (a filler word inside a repeated phrase, dead
//! air flanking a retake). Applying merges overlapping/adjacent accepted ranges into disjoint
//! source intervals first (see [`merge_source_ranges`]) so a sequence of ripple-deletes can't
//! double-cut or produce inconsistent edges.
