//! Generates lightweight "proxy" transcodes for editing/scrubbing — the same trick CapCut,
//! Premiere and Resolve use: decode a small, easy-to-seek proxy file while editing, then
//! conform back to the original full-resolution source only at export time. Keeps timeline
//! scrubbing and preview responsive on large 4K/60fps gameplay captures that would otherwise
//! be expensive to decode every frame.
//!
//! Like [`crate::probe`]/[`crate::render`], the transcode ([`ensure_proxy`]) goes through
//! `oca-avbridge`'s FFI — no subprocess — wrapped around a pure path/freshness check
//! ([`proxy_path_for`], [`is_up_to_date`]).
