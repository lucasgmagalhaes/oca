//! CF-04 (`spec/architecture/competitive-feature-plan.md`): dynamic auto-reframe — instead of
//! [`crate::auto_reframe`]'s single centered-on-one-detected-frame static crop, sample the
//! clip's subject position at several points across its own duration and turn the resulting
//! trajectory into sparse [`crate::timeline::ClipInstance::crop_x_keyframes`]/`_y`/`_w`/`_h`, so
//! a subject that moves across the frame stays framed throughout instead of only at the single
//! moment the static version happened to sample.
//!
//! This module is deliberately just the *trajectory* half — turning a series of per-sample
//! subject centers into keyframes. Detection itself is unchanged, reusing
//! [`crate::auto_reframe::detect_faces`]/[`crate::auto_reframe::main_subject_center`]/
//! [`crate::auto_reframe::compute_reframe_crop`] exactly as the static version already does, one
//! call per sample — no second detection mechanism, no new ONNX surface.
//!
//! **Scope cuts from the full CF-04 spec, deliberate and documented, not silent gaps:**
//! - "Bounded adaptive cadence" — now content-adaptive too, via [`augment_sample_times_for_cuts`]
//!   (see its own doc comment): the fixed cadence itself still comes from
//!   [`crate::frame_sampler::FrameSampler::even_sample_times`] (same primitive
//!   [`crate::motion_tracking`]'s tracker already uses), called by the `ui`-side orchestration
//!   that drives this module, not duplicated here, but that orchestration now thickens the
//!   sample list around a detected hard cut ([`crate::scene_detection::detect_scene_cuts`],
//!   reused rather than a second detector) using frames it already decoded for face detection,
//!   at no extra decode cost for the common no-cuts case.
//! - "Select the primary subject using continuity, size, confidence" — each sample
//!   independently reuses [`crate::auto_reframe::main_subject_center`]'s existing
//!   highest-confidence-wins rule; there's no cross-sample identity tracking (e.g. two people
//!   trading which one has the highest per-frame confidence would visibly re-target between
//!   samples, smoothed but not corrected). A real, separate future improvement, not attempted
//!   here — the doc's own "optional user seed" is also not implemented.
//! - "Show the proposed path and allow correction before applying" — no new review UI. The
//!   emitted crop keyframes land directly in the properties panel's existing Crop X/Y/W/H
//!   Keyframes sections (already editable there), the same "existing UI is the review step"
//!   precedent D4's chapter-marker detection already established instead of a bespoke
//!   accept/reject modal.
