//! Motion tracking — per `request.md`'s Fase 4 "Motion tracking": follow a subject's on-screen
//! movement and use it to drive [`crate::timeline::ClipInstance::position_keyframes`], so a
//! layer (e.g. a small webcam corner, or a graphic pinned to something in the footage) rides
//! along with the tracked point instead of staying at one fixed spot for the whole clip.
//!
//! Plain template tracking (fixed-template block matching, full search within a radius each
//! frame) — no ML model, no new dependency, deliberately simple. [`track_region`] is pure and
//! frame-source-agnostic (fed pre-decoded [`GrayFrame`]s), so it's fully unit testable against
//! synthetic frames; the caller (`ui`'s `App::spawn_motion_track_selected_clip`) is what
//! actually decodes real video frames via `crate::preview::Preview`.
//!
//! **Output convention:** [`tracked_positions_to_keyframes`] converts each frame's tracked
//! center into a *delta* from the first frame's tracked center, added to a fixed
//! `base_position` — the produced [`crate::keyframe::Keyframe<crate::keyframe::Position>`] list
//! makes the layer ride along with the tracked motion while keeping its initial on-canvas
//! placement, rather than snapping to wherever the tracked point happens to sit in the source
//! frame (a meaningless canvas position, since the tracked region's coordinates are in *source*
//! frame space, not canvas space).
