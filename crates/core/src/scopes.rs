//! Waveform/vectorscope monitors for calibrated color grading — per `request.md`'s Fase 4 color
//! tools and `spec/matrix/effects-and-color.md`'s "Known gaps" entry (LUTs/filters exist, no way
//! to calibrate exposure/saturation precisely). Pure pixel-crunching against an already-decoded
//! RGBA frame ([`crate::preview::VideoFrame::rgba`]) — no new avfilter/GStreamer element
//! involved, so this works against exactly the same frame the preview already shows.
//!
//! **Simplification, not a hard wall**: a professional scope draws a green-phosphor trace with a
//! calibrated graticule (IRE/percent gridlines, hue targets on the vectorscope). These render a
//! grayscale intensity image instead — accurate for judging exposure spread (waveform) and
//! saturation/hue spread (vectorscope) at a glance, just without the reference overlay. Good
//! enough to spot a clipped highlight or an oversaturated color cast; not a substitute for a
//! calibrated broadcast monitor.
