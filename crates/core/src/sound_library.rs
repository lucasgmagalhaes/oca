//! Local music/SFX catalog for `request.md`'s Fase 4 "Biblioteca de música e efeitos sonoros".
//!
//! Nothing here is bundled with the app — per this codebase's no-mock-data rule, and since
//! licensing real royalty-free tracks is out of scope for this pass, [`scan_library_dir`]
//! simply reads whatever audio files the user has dropped into a folder they configure
//! themselves (see `ui`'s Preferences screen). The library starts empty until that folder has
//! a `music/` or `sfx/` subfolder with files in it.
