# Regression coverage for the clip properties panel's collapsible sections
# (components::property_section, crates/ui/src/components/property.rs +
# crates/ui/src/screens/editor/properties_panel/mod.rs) — previously every one of the panel's
# ~30 property sections (Gain, Crop, Vignette, Color Adjust, ...) was always fully expanded
# regardless of whether the selected clip actually used that effect. property_section now wraps
# its content in an egui::CollapsingHeader, closed by default unless the caller reports the
# property already holds a non-default value.
#
# This test only covers the "closed by default, click to expand/collapse" mechanics — a fresh
# clip added straight from the media library has every property at its default, so its Gain
# section should start collapsed, expand on click (revealing its slider), and collapse again on
# a second click. It does *not* cover the "already-set property starts open" half (that needs a
# clip whose properties were set before this panel is ever shown for it, e.g. a saved project
# fixture with an edited clip — no such fixture exists under e2e/ yet), which stays covered by
# the plain Rust logic (is_cropped()/has_vignette()/etc. predicates feeding `default_open`) and
# manual verification instead.
#
# Slider counts are used rather than checking for the crop DragValue/color-picker controls
# directly, since egui::Slider is a real accesskit-exposed widget (see conftest.py's module
# docstring) and every property_section this test cares about is delta-tested against its own
# open/closed slider count rather than an absolute one — the Editor screen's timeline zoom
# slider (always present) would otherwise throw off a plain "0 sliders visible" assertion.
