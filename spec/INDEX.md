# spec/ — Start Here

Split out of `CLAUDE.md`'s old single giant "Status" section (2026-08-27), same pattern used
in nimble (sibling project): a task only needs the 2-3 small files relevant to it, not one
huge file.

## Reading order

1. **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** — the actionable queue. Pick your next item here first.
2. **[RULES.md](RULES.md)** — mandatory rules + definition of done. Short, read every time.
3. The specific `matrix/*.md` (current status + file references) and/or `architecture/*.md`
   (the _how_/_why_) file(s) ROADMAP.md points you to.

For the post-P4 product-growth queue, read
**[architecture/competitive-feature-plan.md](architecture/competitive-feature-plan.md)** after
ROADMAP and RULES. It contains the current competitor evidence, ordered implementation slices,
acceptance criteria, security constraints, and deliberate non-goals.

Before broad beta distribution, read
**[architecture/client-error-reporting.md](architecture/client-error-reporting.md)** for ER-01's
consent, sanitization, offline delivery, symbolication, and native-crash rollout requirements.

Before implementing accounts, billing, feature gates, or commercial packaging, read
**[architecture/monetization-and-licensing.md](architecture/monetization-and-licensing.md)** for
MON-01's Free/Pro boundary, monthly price, downgrade guarantees, entitlement protocol, GPL
distribution obligations, security controls, metrics, and rollout gates.

For the expanded offline text catalog, read
**[architecture/built-in-font-catalog.md](architecture/built-in-font-catalog.md)** for FONT-01's
curated families, official sources, package budget, licenses, renderer migration, and cache design.
Read **[architecture/complex-text-shaping.md](architecture/complex-text-shaping.md)** with it when
working on bidi, ligatures, Unicode line breaking, timed highlight clusters, or international
fallback.

Do not read every file here for one task. Read `matrix/changelog.md` only when you need the
historical "why was it built this way" detail (verification caveats, real bugs found, empirical
discoveries) — it's a narrative log of already-completed work, not a task list.

## Keeping this in sync

When you finish a `ROADMAP.md` item:

1. Flip its `- [ ]` to `- [x]` (or `[~]`) in the relevant `matrix/*.md` file, one-line note +
   file reference.
2. Update its line in `ROADMAP.md` too — matrix files are the detailed source, ROADMAP is the
   reconciled summary; they can drift, ROADMAP wins on "what's next."
3. Doc-update commit, separate from the code commit (`docs: mark <item> done`).

Never overwrite a spec file wholesale — edit the specific line/section touched.

---

Also relevant, outside `spec/`: `CLAUDE.md` (repo-wide conventions, crate architecture, build
gotchas), `AGENTS.md` (same content, Codex-facing mirror), `features/request.md` (the original
phased plan this queue picks up after — kept as-is, historical).
